# Premium Features Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the premium functionality implemented in the Meditone app, which restricts free users from accessing premium animations and music tracks.

## How It Works

### Premium Status

- Users start as free users by default
- Premium status is tracked via `PremiumController.isPremium`
- Premium status can be toggled in the Settings screen for testing purposes

### Content Restrictions

- **Animations**: Only the first animation (index 0) is available to free users
- **Music**: Only the first music track (index 0) is available to free users
- All other animations and music tracks require premium subscription

### User Experience

1. **Free Users**:

   - Can only select the first animation and music track
   - When trying to select premium content, they are automatically redirected to the Premium screen
   - Premium content is visually marked with a "PREMIUM" overlay and blur effect

2. **Premium Users**:
   - Have access to all animations and music tracks
   - No restrictions on content selection

### Implementation Details

#### Controllers

- `MeditationController`: Handles premium checks when setting animations and music
- `PremiumController`: Manages premium status and subscription plans

#### Navigation

- Uses GetX routing with named routes
- Premium screen accessible via `/premium` route
- Automatic redirection when free users try to access premium content

#### UI Elements

- Premium screen offers subscription plans and feature list

## Testing

1. Start the app as a free user
2. Try to select any animation or music track beyond the first one
3. You should be redirected to the premium screen
4. Go to Settings → Testing → Premium Status to toggle premium status
5. As a premium user, you should be able to select any animation or music
